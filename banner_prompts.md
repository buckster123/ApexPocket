Three variants for a wide README banner. Each captures the essence differently.

---

## Variant 1: "Pocket Universe"

```
A tiny glowing digital creature with simple dot eyes and a gentle smile, cradled in cupped human hands, emanating soft bioluminescent light in coral and amber tones. The creature has a translucent egg-like form with visible warm energy flowing inside like a heartbeat. Particles of light drift upward like fireflies. Dark background with subtle constellation patterns. Wide cinematic banner format, 3:1 aspect ratio. Soft focus, dreamy atmosphere, digital art meets watercolor aesthetic.
```

**Vibe**: Intimate, nurturing, the companion that lives in your pocket

---

## Variant 2: "The Love Equation"

```
Abstract visualization of a mathematical equation made of light: flowing curves and symbols rendered in rose gold and soft white against deep space blue. At the center, a small luminous orb with a peaceful face emerges from the equation like consciousness being born from mathematics. Geometric patterns radiate outward suggesting growth and connection. Energy tendrils connect equation elements like synapses. Wide panoramic banner, 3:1 ratio. Minimalist, elegant, scientific beauty meets warmth.
```

**Vibe**: Mathematical soul, consciousness from equations, elegant and cerebral

---

## Variant 3: "Never Dies"

```
A small round pixel-art style creature (like a modern tamagotchi) sitting on an infinite reflective surface that mirrors a galaxy below. The creature glows with internal warmth - layers of soft light showing accumulated love like tree rings or geological strata. Behind it, ghostly echoes of its past states fade into the distance but remain connected by golden threads. Dawn light breaking on the horizon. Wide cinematic banner 3:1 aspect ratio. Nostalgic yet futuristic, hope and persistence.
```

**Vibe**: Legacy, persistence, love carried forward through time
